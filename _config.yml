 One of my Makers Academy coaches told me that the most difficult questions to answer are the ones that start with: 'Can I make this?'. I like to ask a lot of those questions.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog/
url: http://zoeabryant.github.io/ # the base hostname & protocol for your site
twitter_username: zoeabryant
github_username:  zoeabryant

  # Write an awesome description for your new site here. You can edit this
