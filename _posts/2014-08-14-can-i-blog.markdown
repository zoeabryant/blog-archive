### Objectives
* To advance my knowledge of technology and code
* To record problems and solutions I've faced in the hope that it will help myself, and possibly others
* To encourage myself to code awesome things that I will want to share
* To potentially build up a portfolio, or cv fodder (yay!)

### Implementation
I decided to make this blog, and in the process have adjusted to Jekyll for the first time.

Also getting the hang of spelling Jekyll right the first time.

### Resources
[Jekyll rb docs](http://jekyllrb.com/)

[Using Jekyll with Github pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages)

[Markdown Cheatsheet of choice](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

[Then Gruber's Markdown syntax when I realised Jekyll doesn't do pure markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

[Tags in Jekyll](http://charliepark.org/tags-in-jekyll)

### Conclusion
Erm, I'll get back to you on that one.
