Makers Academy students who over halfway through the course are encouraged to help out the new students that are just starting. Last Thursday (07/08/2014) I did a talk on Sublime Text Shortcuts so they can make the most of their code editor.

I really like keyboard shortcuts in a really nerdy way, the efficiency just appeals to me. I don't know if I'll always use Sublime, but I like to think that if I'm going to use a code editor every day I'll take some time to know how to get around.

Anyway, for this talk I figured it wasn't fair to expect people to manage to note down everything in the 20mins or so that I had to present, so I created a cheatsheet.

I really enjoyed the talk! I've since heard this cheatsheet is actually in frequent use by the junior cohort, which is just awesome. It's not quite as comprehensive as most shortcut cheat sheets, but I felt it was important to prioritise the ones I use on a day to day basis.

Without futher ado:
