For my birthday this week I finally got organised on ordering myself an arduino. Specifically, A [Start Arduino Kit][startkit] from [Technology Will Save Us][twsu], a London company that does some pretty cool things for tech education.

Now I can't exactly say I know much about electronics. In fact, talk of circuits, LEDs and wires gives me flashbacks to year 6, and I'm pretty sure I've taken some more science lessons since then. This wasn't enough to put me off. Thankfully, I am in a place where I am surrounded by techy people who get excited about this kind of stuff too, so I was able to enlist the help of [Roi][roi], a Makers Academy coach, who could walk me through the basics.

### So what exactly is an arduino?
An [Arduino][ardof] is a **microcontroller**. It can be used to respond to its surroundings - detect light level, if the device is being tilted, air pressure, that kind of thing. It can be used to respond to input, set it up with a button to create a game. There are so many [projects][projects] that can be done with it, I'm not really sure where to begin. So I went for a cliche - making lights flash.
